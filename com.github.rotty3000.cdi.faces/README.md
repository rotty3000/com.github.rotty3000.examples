## CDI/JSF Example

**Note:** This sample uses prototypical features of `bnd` which are only in the [snapshot repo](https://bndtools.jfrog.io/bndtools/libs-snapshot/). This project is already configured to use it. So this build should work.

After building try running:

```sh
]$ mvn bnd-run:run@equinox
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/home.xhtml`
